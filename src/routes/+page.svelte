    Dearest reader,<br>
    My name is <a href="/">Jitse De Smet</a>.
    I am a <a href="publications">doctoral researcher</a> at <a href="http://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en">IDLab</a> with the
    <a href="https://knows.idlab.ugent.be/">KNoWS</a> research group.
    My research focuses on writing abstractions for decentralized data ecosystems.

<p>
    These abstractions are brought to life using the <a href="https://comunica.dev/">Comunica</a> query engine.
    I have many years of developers experience in the comunica project.
    Dating back to many conributions made in the expression evaluator,
    previously known as <a href="https://github.com/comunica/sparqlee">sparqlee</a>.
